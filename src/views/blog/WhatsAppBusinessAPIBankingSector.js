                              Unlike calls, WhatsApp allows you to promote your
                              WhatsApp business for banking services by sharing
                              rich media content and enabling instantaneous
                              client connections at a very low cost.

                              For example, using a chatbot for basic customer
                              service inquiries saves your company a ton of time
                              and money by removing the need for large call
