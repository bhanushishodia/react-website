                                            <p>Have you recently noticed any changes in WhatsApp? No… no… I am not talking about the app’s upgraded version, nor the app changing the user interface, but about businesses getting recognition by showcasing a green tick verification badge earlier on their profile.</p>
                                        </div>
                                        <div className="text d-flex mb-20">
                                            <p>While receivers feel secure, they get messages from the original brand, which creates a positive image of the company in the user’s mind.</p>

                                            <p>But did you know that WhatsApp has changed green tick verification to a blue color tick? Must be wondering why this sudden change took place, right?</p>
                                        </div>

                                                <p><b>WhatsApp Green Tick</b> is an official checkmark that is provided by WhatsApp to show that the brand is genuine and trustworthy. This green tick mark shows that WhatsApp has verified this brand, and users can fully trust it.</p>

                                        <p className="text mb-10">Meta has dynamically taken this decision due to multiple reasons:</p>
                                        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
                                            <li><b>Now available for small businesses:</b> WhatsApp Blue Tick is available to all businesses using the WhatsApp Business app and WhatsApp Business API. WhatsApp Green Tick was limited to companies using the WhatsApp Business API.</li>
                                            <li><b>Maintain Consistent Branding Throughout Meta Services:</b> Aligning consistent branding across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp—the three Meta products—was a primary motivator for the switch from <b>Green Tick to a Blue Tick.</b></li>
                                            <li><b>Improved Trust and Authenticity:</b> The WhatsApp Business profile's blue checkmark confirms that the brand users are interacting with is indeed a legitimate, trustworthy, and authentic brand.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                            <li>The WhatsApp blue tick symbol will indicate Meta’s support for your business profile. This proves your reliability, which might increase client loyalty to your verified brand profile.</li>
                                            <li>Businesses that have active Meta accounts will have an advantage over those that don't. The blue Meta-certified badge will increase sales, generate more leads, and show professionalism and trustworthiness.</li>

                                        <p>WhatsApp’s move from green to a blue tick is to make it simpler for companies to get verified and maintain consistency across Meta’s platforms. This blue tick will help customers trust your business more, showing them that your brand is genuine.</p>
                                        <p>Businesses have to keep in mind that the following requirements should be fulfilled: Meta Business Manager, a WhatsApp business API account, and a few press releases while chasing for a blue tick.</p>
