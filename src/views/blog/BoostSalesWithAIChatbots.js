                    The Indian festive season has already begun! Southeast Asia (SEA) and other world regions will shortly begin it. Businesses must develop creative methods to interact with clients and effectively meet their needs as we prepare for this wonderful period. After all, festival seasons are when customers feel the most inclined to splurge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To finally make their excitedly anticipated purchase, many eagerly await specials, deals, and discounts. To capitalize on this need, brands must connect with consumers where they are and provide them with experiences they'll never forget.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Customers typically have higher expectations during this time of year, and businesses need to be prompt and individualized in their responses. Seeing warnings like "Out of Stock" or "Delivery not available" frustrates customers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even though brands can create excitement with promotions and deals, it all fades out because of bad customer service.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Brands have fantastic potential to create personalized, one-on-one interaction through chats with chatbots. A more seamless and customized shopping experience is now possible thanks to the development of generative AI, which also enables firms to create chatbots that engage in intelligent conversations and are more human-like.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this blog, we'll look at how companies can use chatbots powered by generative AI to increase sales, foster customer loyalty, and produce standout shopping experiences over the holiday season. You can learn more about how brands can leverage generative AI for customer acquisition, conversion, and retention by reading this blog.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's also crucial to understand the channels for these chatbots before getting started. Given WhatsApp's widespread use (2.7 billion users), it makes for the ideal medium for grabbing consumers' attention. WhatsApp is used by users for an average of 17 hours per month.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Thus, generative AI bots on the <a href="https://anantya.ai"><strong>WhatsApp Business API</strong></a> combine to create a potent force that enables marketers to reach consumers on their preferred channels and offer exceptional conversational experiences.

                  <h3 id="section1" className="wp-block-heading py-4">
                    Using WhatsApp AI Bots for Customer Acquisition and Marketing
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    In comparison with structured bots, generative AI bots create a language that sounds like people, resulting in interactions with customers that are authentic and interesting. These bots analyze client information to provide tailored product recommendations that increase the possibility that customers will make a purchase.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With <a href="https://anantya.ai/automated-chatbot"><strong>WhatsApp Chatbots</strong></a> leading customers through engaging chat experiences, marketers can effectively acquire new customers and build a first-party database for future sales by utilizing Click to WhatsApp advertisements as lead magnets.

                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Brands can also re-engage dormant consumers on WhatsApp by sending them customized offers and discount codes to entice them to finish their transactions or place repeat orders, increasing the possibility of conversions.
