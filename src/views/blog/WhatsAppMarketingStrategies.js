                  What exactly is WhatsApp marketing?
                </h2>
                <p>
                  WhatsApp marketing is all about promoting goods and services
                  using WhatsApp. Let me break it down for you with a relatable
                  example.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, imagine you went shopping at Zara and treated yourself to
                  some cool clothes. The very next day, you get a sweet 10%
                  discount coupon from Zara right in your WhatsApp messages.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That's exactly what we mean by WhatsApp marketing – businesses
                  reaching out to customers or potential customers personally
                  through WhatsApp to offer special deals and share info about
                  their products or services.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Here's an important point to keep in mind: You can only use

                    <p>
                      WhatsApp allows brands to set up automatic messages for
                      different events like order confirmations, shipping
                      updates, delivery status, appointment reminders, and more.

                    <p>
                      When you integrate this feature, WhatsApp will
                      automatically send these messages to users whenever these
                      events happen. This saves time and makes communication
                      with customers much smoother.

                      Brands can now use <b>Click to WhatsApp Ads</b> on
