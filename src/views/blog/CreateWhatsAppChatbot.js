                                                It can also share useful content and send updates about orders, payments, and shipping directly through WhatsApp.

            <div className="text d-flex mb-20">
                <p>You must first be able to use the business API for WhatsApp. Through its partners, WhatsApp provides access to these APIs directly.</p>

            <div className="text d-flex mb-20">
                <p>You must set up a phone number to use as your WhatsApp business phone number.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="text d-flex mb-20">
                <p>You must ensure that this number can accept calls because WhatsApp will call it to verify and activate it for your WhatsApp Business Account.</p>
