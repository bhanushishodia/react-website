                    How the Government Can Use WhatsApp Business API to Serve Indian Citizens
                  </h1>
                  <p>Have you ever visited a government office? After seeing such a huge waiting queue, do you also feel frustrated or maybe just want to go back home? For small corrections or submitting forms, we have to stand in such big lines and queues! As the world is modernizing and technologies are upgrading, “Dear Government of India” it’s time to upgrade your way of communication with the citizens as well.</p>
                  <p>In a country like India, which has <a href="https://www.statista.com/forecasts/1146773/whatsapp-users-in-india" style={{ color: '#5dc4eb' }} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">535.8 million active WhatsApp users</a>, it is the best tool to choose as your marketing channel. <b>WhatsApp Business API for the Government</b> is not only for businesses, but government agencies can also use it to provide services, share information, and engage with the public in a very convenient and effective manner.</p>
                  <p>Let’s have a look at how using <b>WhatsApp Business API for the Government</b> can improve government services for the department, as well as the citizens.</p>

                    <h2 className="fs-4 mb-10 mt-10">What is WhatsApp Business API for the Government?</h2>
                    <p><a href="whatsapp-business-api-ultimate-guide" style={{ color: '#5dc4eb' }}>WhatsApp Business API</a> can be a very effective tool to reach out to a larger audience at once. Unlike the usual WhatsApp app, which is designed to connect with people while sharing messages, photos, and videos among family & friends, the WhatsApp Business API is made for businesses that send and receive messages in a good quantity on a daily basis.</p>
                    <p>Here the <b>government can use WhatsApp Business API</b> to send important alerts and updates on services, share information about public programs, notify about health precautions, or even help citizens apply for services through WhatsApp.</p>
                    <p><b>WhatsApp Business API for the government</b> will also enable the use of automated chatbots to answer common questions or guide citizens in processes like registrations or applying for public services.</p>
                    <p>Let us list down some amazing features the government has at its disposal with the WhatsApp business API.</p>

                    <h2 className="fs-4 mb-10 mt-10">WhatsApp Features That Can Be Helpful for the Government</h2>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <strong>WhatsApp Catalog: All government services, in one place</strong><br />
                        Make things easier with WhatsApp by giving your users a simple menu on their mobile phones where they can find a list of all the government services along with their concerned departments in the form of a Catalog.<br />
                        <br />WhatsApp’s catalog feature can come in handy for a lot of different reasons, for example, users can find the nearest vaccination centre, learn about public healthcare programs, the nearest E-seva Kendra and its schedule, or get some educational resources. The catalog feature has all the options in a single place.<br />
                        <br />No need to get confused with websites or stand in long lines at government offices for petty concerns or queries; just browse through these services with Anantya.ai’s <a href="whatsapp-catalog" style={{ color: '#5dc4eb' }}>WhatsApp catalog</a> features.<br />
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>WhatsApp Flows</strong><br />
                        Simple tasks seem difficult when it comes to filling out a government form or applying for a certificate, but WhatsApp flow makes these things a lot easier. This feature can help your user through every step of the process, like your own personal assistant.<br /><br />
                        Let’s say you are filling out a form.<br /><br />
                        WhatsApp Flow will make sure you don't get hurdled in the process by first demonstrating how to fill out the form and then helping you every step of the way.
                        WhatsApp flow will make complicated work simpler for your users. <b>The use of WhatsApp Business API for the government</b> can make things more simple for their citizens.
                      </li>
                      <img
                        src={benefitsImage}
                        className="img-fluid my-3"

                      <li>
                        <strong>Carousels</strong><br />
                        Wondering how carousels can be helpful to the government sector?<br />
                        It can get all the information you need in a single message.<br />
                        For example, at the time of elections, voters can receive messages where they can swipe through different options, such as finding the nearest voting booths, candidate profiles, important dates, and voting time slots.<br />
                        Display pictures with details through the WhatsApp Carousel feature. Simplify the whole process with just a few clicks.<br />
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Stay Updated with Notifications</strong><br />
                        Interactive notifications make it easy to stay updated with important information. For example, with <b>WhatsApp Business API, the Government</b> can send reminders about an approaching tax deadline or any important alert about new or upcoming government policies.<br /><br />
                        These notifications will include buttons that will let your user respond faster, whether to download the e-receipt of the paid tax or check the status of the service requested. This way, you can stay updated and informed with <b>WhatsApp API’s interactive notifications.</b><br /><br />
                        It may become a concern when a few of your citizens are not on WhatsApp. Anantya.ai has a solution for that too; whether your consumer is on WhatsApp or not, Anantya.ai’s <a href="whatsapp-business-api-ultimate-guide" style={{ color: '#5dc4eb' }}>SMS Fallback</a> feature sends every notification that is needed through SMS. Hence, you get both solutions in one platform.<br />
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>24/7 Chatbot</strong><br />
                        To get small work done from government offices, it takes up a citizen’s one whole day’s leave or even more, due to the long waiting period. Isn't it frustrating when we don't get an answer quickly?<br /><br />
                        This WhatsApp chatbot will relieve your consumers of their frustration; they will get 24/7 assistance to help with common questions, provide information about things related to government programs, and guide them through simple tasks.<br /><br />
                        Anantya.ai-powered <a href="how-to-create-a-whatsapp-chatbot-for-business" style={{ color: '#5dc4eb' }}>WhatsApp Chatbot</a> will always be ready for all the queries your consumers may have, whether to be their assistant, answer their service-related questions, or get a review form filled out.<br />
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Send Multimedia Messages</strong><br />
                        Always sending long messages won't attract citizens to read them in full. Let photos and pictures say it all. The government can use WhatsApp's multimedia feature to share useful content, like sharing the step-by-step process of applying for a passport or sending what precautions to take during a pandemic.
                        These visual messages will convey important information in a more engaging and simple way, which will help citizens understand and comply better.
