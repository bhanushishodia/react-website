                                        <p>WhatsApp marketing is all about using WhatsApp to stay connected with your
                                            clients in a more personal and direct way. In comparison with emails or
                                            social media posts, businesses can use WhatsApp to send updates, share
                                            promotions, and provide customer support to their clients.
