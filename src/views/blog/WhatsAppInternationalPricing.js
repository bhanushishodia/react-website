                        Reaching millions of people with just a single click,
                        the world has grown digitally. WhatsApp has become the
                        first-ever choice for businesses to connect with their
                        people all over the world. With millions of WhatsApp

                        With the increasing popularity of WhatsApp in the
                        business world, a recent change in WhatsApp pricing for
                        authentication messages has shown a significant change
                        in the telecom industry.

                          Let's Have a Quick Go-Through of WhatsApp Capping 2024
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                          WhatsApp announced its capping regulation set for
                          2024. This regulation limits the number of promotional
                          messages businesses can send via WhatsApp. The motto
                          behind this regulation is to reduce spam and enhance
                          the user experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The capping is seen as a positive step toward a more
                          user-friendly platform; this also means that
                          businesses now have fewer opportunities to engage with
                          customers. These rules are making businesses question
                          how to use WhatsApp for communication, especially in
                          light of the growing expense of authenticating
                          messages.
