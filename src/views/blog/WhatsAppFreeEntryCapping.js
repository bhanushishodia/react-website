                                    WhatsApp’s Free Entry Point and Frequency Capping in 2024: What Businesses Need to Know
                                </h1>
                                <p>With the 2024 update, Meta’s new change in WhatsApp has shaken things up. This update has limited how businesses can send promotional messages. This change is totally about decreasing spam and improving the user experience for better engagement.</p>
                                <p>However, there is a wider picture through WhatsApp's Free Entry Point. This feature offers businesses a way to engage with customers, as users are the ones who get to take action first.</p>

                                <h2 className="main-title fs-4 mb-10">What are free-entry point conversations?</h2>
                                <p>In simple terms, the Free Entry Point is a window that lets businesses engage with their clients without being restricted by <a href="/meta-new-frequency-capping-update" style={{ color: '#5dc4eb' }}>frequency capping</a> limitations. It’s one of the great ways to reach out and establish a connection with their audience.</p>
                                <p>This feature makes you worry-free as users initiate the conversation, and the window is open for 24 hours, where businesses have no restrictions on sending marketing messages until the period ends.</p>

                                <p><b>Starting the conversation:</b> A free entry point conversation starts when the consumer initiates the conversation through your Facebook page call-to-action or through a <a href="/click-to-whatsapp-ads-marketing-2023" style={{ color: '#5dc4eb' }}>click-to-WhatsApp ad</a> button. The conversation begins if the business responds to their message within a span of 24 hours.</p>

                                <p><b>Duration and Use:</b> If the free entry point is opened once, the window is available for a period of 24 hours only. Businesses are not charged more to send any type of communication during this time period.</p>
                                <p>But if one doesn't reply within the allotted 24 hours, you have to develop a message template, which might cost extra and come under the marketing, utility, or authentication areas.</p>

                                <p><b>Managing Conversations:</b> Any open discussion of customers is immediately shut down when businesses start a free entry point chat. It is not possible to initiate new discussions until the Free Entry Point time closes. Free-form communications can only be sent when a customer support window is active.</p>
                                <p>Once the 24-hour service window closes, a new one will open if the consumer initiates a conversation again.</p>

                                <p>Did you know with <a href="/" style={{ color: '#5dc4eb' }}>Anantya.ai</a> you can handle your Instagram, Facebook, and Telegram all in one panel? Businesses can also redirect their clients to WhatsApp by displaying advertisements on their websites.</p>

                                <h2 id="add-instagram-facebook-ctas" className="fs-3 my-3">How do I add Instagram and Facebook CTAs?</h2>
                                <p>Businesses can use one smart strategy to increase interaction with WhatsApp by using Facebook and Instagram to increase traffic to the app.</p>
                                <p className="fw-bold">Here’s how you can set it up:</p>
                                
                                <p><b>Instagram:</b> For easily communicating with your users, businesses may include a “click to WhatsApp” button on their company profile. There is one more little thing that you can do- add a button to your Instagram stories, which will provide users with another direct connection to your WhatsApp account.</p>

                                <p><b>Facebook:</b> Businesses can add a “Send Message” button on their page that will take users directly to your WhatsApp, as you can with Instagram. Another thing you can do is run advertisements on WhatsApp with a call to action button, encouraging consumers to get in touch with your company.</p>
                                <p>Businesses can make use of WhatsApp's Free Entry Points by including these features, increasing consumer engagement while lowering costs.</p>
