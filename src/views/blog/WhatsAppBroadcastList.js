                        WhatsApp Broadcast
                      </a>{' '}
                      is a WhatsApp Business API feature which helps you send a document, picture, video, or
                      message to several users at once. This function is extremely valuable to marketers and
                      business owners since it allows them to access a larger pool of potential customers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In a conversation between a WhatsApp Business account and its clients, a broadcast message is
                      displayed as a private message. The broadcast message will be followed by an individual chat
                      if the recipients reply. Unlike WhatsApp groups, this is private and only you and the
                      consumer may see it—the campaign's full audience cannot.

                    <h2 className="fs-4 mb-10 mt-10">How do I Create a WhatsApp Broadcast List?</h2>
                    <p>
                      To set up a <b>WhatsApp broadcast list,</b> simply follow the instructions briefed below:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Step 1: Add contacts to the Excel sheet.</strong> <br />
                        First, create an Excel sheet of customer data and who you want to send the broadcast to.
                        Anantya.ai allows you to select contacts individually or upload a sheet where you have
                        saved the contacts in a specific format.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Step 2: Create a contact list.</strong> <br />
                        Start with feeding your contacts into the messaging platform you are going to use before
                        sending out any messages through WhatsApp API’s bulk messaging feature. Assign all your
                        contacts into relevant groups based on factors like their interests, past purchase history,
                        or location. This can help businesses send targeted and personalized messages to each
                        group, increasing the chances of engagement.
                      </li>

                        customers are one-on-one conversations as these messages are customized and personalized.
                      </li>
                      <li>

                        promotes a feeling of privacy and security because their answers are received personally to
