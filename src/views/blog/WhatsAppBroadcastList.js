                        Have you ever wondered about sending out messages to
                        hundreds of customers on WhatsApp without the need to
                        copy-paste the same text again and again while sending
                        it to different numbers? It sounds like a lengthy
                        process, isn’t it?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Well, that’s exactly what WhatsApp Broadcast list does
                        and can save you lots of time. With 2 billion WhatsApp
                        users, there is hardly any chance of a person not using
                        WhatsApp. That makes WhatsApp Broadcast the most
                        powerful tool for reaching your audience.

                        you're sharing updates, promoting your latest offers, or
                        just keeping your consumers interested. It's quick and
                        efficient, while keeping your conversation secure from
                        end-to-end, without landing your account into spam.

                          is a WhatsApp Business API feature which helps you
                          send a document, picture, video, or message to several
                          users at once. This function is extremely valuable to
                          marketers and business owners since it allows them to
                          access a larger pool of potential customers.

                          In a conversation between a WhatsApp Business account
                          and its clients, a broadcast message is displayed as a
                          private message. The broadcast message will be
                          followed by an individual chat if the recipients
                          reply. Unlike WhatsApp groups, this is private and
                          only you and the consumer may see it—the campaign's
                          full audience cannot.

                          To set up a <b>WhatsApp broadcast list,</b> simply
                          follow the instructions briefed below:

                            <br />
                            First, create an Excel sheet of customer data and
                            who you want to send the broadcast to. Anantya.ai
                            allows you to select contacts individually or upload
                            a sheet where you have saved the contacts in a
                            specific format.

                            platform you are going to use before sending out any
                            messages through WhatsApp API’s bulk messaging
                            feature. Assign all your contacts into relevant

                            purchase history, or location. This can help
                            businesses send targeted and personalized messages
                            to each group, increasing the chances of engagement.

                            Your clients receive messages provided via a
                            broadcast list as individual messages. This promotes
                            a feeling of privacy and security because their
                            answers are received personally to you and not the
                            entire list.
