                      When WhatsApp introduced the WhatsApp Business app, it
                      came out as a great tool for small businesses to interact
                      with customers. However, Facebook soon realized that
                      medium and large businesses had more complex needs, so
                      keeping their needs in mind, they opened up access to the
                      WhatsApp Business API.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Now, you might wonder what the difference is between the
                      app and the API. Well, for those who aren't technically
                      inclined, it can be a bit confusing. If you’re struggling
                      to understand the differences between App and API, keep
                      reading the blog to know the right choice for your
                      business solutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The WhatsApp Business app is like a standalone application
                      that anyone can easily install on their mobile phones. It
                      is a free app basically made for small business owners.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      WhatsApp came out as a popular messaging app with{" "}
                      <strong>2 million users worldwide,</strong> businesses
                      started using it to communicate with their customers, but
                      normal WhatsApp didn't have the right features.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      With the <strong>WhatsApp Business app,</strong> those
                      problems were solved. Now, small business owners can make
                      detailed business profiles, show their working hours, and
                      display their products. They can even set up automatic
                      welcome and away messages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It's a useful tool that helps small businesses to
                      communicate better with their customers and manage their
                      business interactions more efficiently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      On the other hand, the WhatsApp Business API is more
                      suited for medium and large businesses. Since WhatsApp
                      Business App’s Capabilities were limited, WhatsApp decided
                      to introduce a new solution for growing businesses called
                      the WhatsApp Business API.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The WhatsApp Business API,{" "}

                      , lets businesses send and receive unlimited messages to
                      people all around the world through WhatsApp.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      By using this API, businesses can create better
                      experiences for their customers on WhatsApp and reach a
                      wider audience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It's not a standalone app, but rather a set of tools and
                      functions that developers can integrate into their
                      existing systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      WhatsApp Business API gives developers the freedom to
                      build tools that eliminate these restrictions and even add
                      new features. This flexibility allows businesses to
                      integrate various tools to make WhatsApp even more
                      powerful and tailored to their specific needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      With the API, you can send messages programmatically, set
                      up chatbots, and manage a large volume of customer
                      conversations efficiently.

                      We'll compare WhatsApp Business App and WhatsApp Business

                      <strong>

                      and can handle only a few customer conversations. It's

                      </strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      On the other hand, WhatsApp Business Platform (API) can
                      send broadcasts to any number of people depending upon
                      your tier level. That is a different concept though.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Moreover, the reach of WhatsApp Business App broadcasts is
                      limited to those who have saved the business number in
                      their contacts. But with WhatsApp Business Platform (API),
                      there are no such restrictions, and the messages can reach
                      anyone.

                      In WhatsApp Business App, it's not simple to share your
                      inbox with team members. You can try using WhatsApp Web,
                      but it has some drawbacks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      For example, if someone gets logged out, you need to help
                      them log back in. Also, you won't know who replied to a
                      message, and it's challenging to see which conversations
                      have been handled.

                    <p>
                      In WhatsApp Business App, you can make voice calls like
                      you do in regular WhatsApp.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      But, as of now, the WhatsApp Business Platform (API)
                      doesn't support voice calls. This means partner services
                      cannot offer this feature.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      However, don't worry! You can still make voice calls using
                      your phone's regular phone services with the same WhatsApp
                      Business number.

                      WhatsApp Business App can only be installed on one phone,
                      but you can use WhatsApp Web on up to 4 devices to access
                      it. However, WhatsApp Web is not suitable for multiple
                      users, leading to some limitations:

                      In the WhatsApp Business App, you can automate only
