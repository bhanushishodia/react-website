                    When WhatsApp introduced the WhatsApp Business app, it came
                    out as a great tool for small businesses to interact with
                    customers. However, Facebook soon realized that medium and
                    large businesses had more complex needs, so keeping their
                    needs in mind, they opened up access to the WhatsApp
                    Business API.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, you might wonder what the difference is between the app
                    and the API. Well, for those who aren't technically
                    inclined, it can be a bit confusing. If you’re struggling to
                    understand the differences between App and API, keep reading
                    the blog to know the right choice for your business
                    solutions.

                  <p>
                    The WhatsApp Business app is like a standalone application
                    that anyone can easily install on their mobile phones. It is
                    a free app basically made for small business owners.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    WhatsApp came out as a popular messaging app with{" "}
                    <strong>2 million users worldwide,</strong> businesses
                    started using it to communicate with their customers, but
                    normal WhatsApp didn't have the right features.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With the <strong>WhatsApp Business app,</strong> those
                    problems were solved. Now, small business owners can make
                    detailed business profiles, show their working hours, and
                    display their products. They can even set up automatic
                    welcome and away messages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's a useful tool that helps small businesses to
                    communicate better with their customers and manage their
                    business interactions more efficiently.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On the other hand, the WhatsApp Business API is more suited
                    for medium and large businesses. Since WhatsApp Business
                    App’s Capabilities were limited, WhatsApp decided to
                    introduce a new solution for growing businesses called the
                    WhatsApp Business API.

                    , lets businesses send and receive unlimited messages to
                    people all around the world through WhatsApp.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By using this API, businesses can create better experiences
                    for their customers on WhatsApp and reach a wider audience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's not a standalone app, but rather a set of tools and
                    functions that developers can integrate into their existing
                    systems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    WhatsApp Business API gives developers the freedom to build
                    tools that eliminate these restrictions and even add new
                    features. This flexibility allows businesses to integrate
                    various tools to make WhatsApp even more powerful and
                    tailored to their specific needs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With the API, you can send messages programmatically, set up
                    chatbots, and manage a large volume of customer
                    conversations efficiently.

                  <p>
                    On the other hand, WhatsApp Business Platform (API) can send
                    broadcasts to any number of people depending upon your tier
                    level. That is a different concept though.

                    Moreover, the reach of WhatsApp Business App broadcasts is
                    limited to those who have saved the business number in their
                    contacts. But with WhatsApp Business Platform (API), there

                    In WhatsApp Business App, it's not simple to share your

                    it has some drawbacks.

                  <p>
                    For example, if someone gets logged out, you need to help
                    them log back in. Also, you won't know who replied to a
                    message, and it's challenging to see which conversations
                    have been handled.

                    In WhatsApp Business App, you can make voice calls like you

                    But, as of now, the WhatsApp Business Platform (API) doesn't

                    With WhatsApp Business App, you can only send messages to

                    However, using the WhatsApp Business Platform (API) involves

                    In conclusion, if you’re a small business with basic needs
                    and limited customer interactions, the WhatsApp Business App
                    is likely a great fit for you.
                  </p>

                    However, if you have a larger business with more complex
                    requirements and want to integrate advanced features and
                    automation, then the WhatsApp Business Platform (API) would
                    be a better choice.

                  <p>
                    Choosing between these two options depends on your business
                    size, needs, and budget. Both solutions offer valuable
                    features for enhancing customer communication, so assess
                    your requirements carefully to make the best decision.
